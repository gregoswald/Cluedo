I changed the player class to an interface that the pieces implement i figured that the players and the
piece they play could be one and the same, but may be it might be good to change that back and make a piece interface.

stairs

game states

i need to refine the mouse interface.

the colors need replacing with custom rgbs or something. i think i might draw an overlay, it will remove alot of complicated
code, and wont effect anything.

some kind of valid move verification, bounds checking etc

dice, random number generator.
